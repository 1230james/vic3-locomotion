# Private expansion controls
# Used to control whether private investment/autonomous construction is allowed to expand infrastructure buildings

# Private investment seems to not understand which infrastructure buildings are or are not efficient to expand to cover
# infrastructure deficits & complex logic for building selection weights aren't a thing, so we'll let the player dictate
# whether they want to allow or stop private investment from expanding them.
