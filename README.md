# Locomotion: Land, Water, & Air

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Locomotion: Land, Water, & Air** (LLWA) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) that aims to lightly overhaul the current Railways sector into a Transport Network sector, expanding its scope from strictly railroads to include roads, canals, and airports.

With LLWA, adding infrastructure to your country before the invention of railroads beyond the capabilities of your ports becomes a reality. Simulating everything from primitive road traffic to the sprouting of air travel, infrastructure becomes both flavorful and manageable. LLWA aims to provide a solution to early infrastructure while also keeping private investments focused on a single building, easily tweakable with production methods, without sprawling out to multiple building types that may not always suit your needs.
