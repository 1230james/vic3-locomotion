# Locomotion: Land, Water, & Air

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Locomotion: Land, Water, & Air** (LLWA) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) that aims to expand the availability of infrastructure from only the Railways & Ports sectors to include sectors representing roads, [inland] canals, and airports.

With LLWA, adding infrastructure to your country before the invention of railroads beyond the capabilities of your ports becomes a reality. Simulating everything from primitive road traffic to the sprouting of air travel, infrastructure becomes both flavorful and manageable. LLWA aims to provide a solution to early infrastructure while also giving players the ability to rein in private investments through special production methods to prevent private investors from expanding infrastructure buildings when the player decides it's disadvantageous to do so.
